							History Of GIT:-
Git Development Began In April 2005, After Many Developers Of The Linux Kernel Gave Up Access To Bitkeeper, A Proprietary Source-Control Management (SCM) System That They Had Formerly Used To Maintain The Project.[14] The Copyright Holder Of Bitkeeper, Larry Mcvoy, Had Withdrawn Free Use Of The Product After Claiming That Andrew Tridgell Had Reverse-Engineered The Bitkeeper Protocols.



							Design Of GIT:-
Git's design was inspired by BitKeeper and Monotone. Git was originally designed as a low-level version-control system engine, on top of which others could write front ends, such as Cogito or StGIT.The core Git project has since become a complete version-control system that is usable directly.While strongly influenced by BitKeeper, Torvalds deliberately avoided conventional approaches, leading to a unique design.
