History Of GIT:-
Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to BitKeeper, a proprietary source-control management (SCM) system that they had formerly used to maintain the project.[14] The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn free use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had reverse-engineered the BitKeeper protocols.


Design Of GIT:-
Git's design was inspired by BitKeeper and Monotone. Git was originally designed as a low-level version-control system engine, on top of which others could write front ends, such as Cogito or StGIT.[28] The core Git project has since become a complete version-control system that is usable directly.While strongly influenced by BitKeeper, Torvalds deliberately avoided conventional approaches, leading to a unique design.
